When to use each container:

1) List -- 
		ArrayList ----- 	When you want to search based on the index
			  				   	   Better performance when there will not be anymore modification to the list
		Linked List --- 	When you think there's going to be a lot of updates for the list (lots of modifications)
		Vector --------- 	 
		
		
		Set: when you don't want duplicates
		List: when you want the data to be sorted in some order
		Map: when you want to be able to search through the data.


Maps - GUESS WORD ----> Key ----> Hash Map;;;; USE AS A LIFE LINE, ONE FREE GUESS
Sets -   EASIER, MODE CHOOSE WORD ----> WITH A STARTING LETTER OF THAT PERSON'S CHOICE  
Lists -   DISPLAY ALL PREVIOUS INPUTS FROM NEWEST TO OLDEST
Stacks (LIFO)----> use to pop out number of turns left
Queues (FIFO)---> stores a list of words for each round
